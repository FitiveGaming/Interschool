                            The purpose of this presentation is to tell people, ABOUT TECHNOLOGY and how it is effective
                            in
                            human lives. There are both
                            good and a bad ways. We will be talking about the great inventors and innovators with their
                            achievements in past some years.
                            We will also be talking about the achievements we can achieve in
                            the future and how they can help us. We already have some great innovators like Elon Musk
                            who is
                            focusing on the future by trying to make life on Mars possible and Jeff Bezos as well. Just
                            like
                            nowadays, our future is heavily dependent on technology. AI and space travel is our future
                            now.

                                    In the past some years humans have developed so much. With the help of technology
                                    humans
                                    are touching new heights. But today humans are heavily dependent on technology. This
                                    era
                                    of technology started out with famous inventor Charles Babbage inventing a computer
                                    which we use nowadays, specially in the time of pandemic and also the invention of
                                    telephone by Alexander Graham Bell. Some useful inventions used in today's tech like
                                    tesla coils or remote controls by Nikola Tesla! Just like them we have innovators of
                                    today like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerburg etc. They are focusing
                                    on
                                    shaping future for humans. Elon Musk has founded "OpenAI" which is developing AIs
                                    and
                                    researching on them. The AI systems made by the company is free which is inturn
                                    motivating developers to switch to AIs in their applications.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    He has also founded "Tesla" which are electrical cars and they don't cause any
                                    polloution. It is very important to switch to electric cars. As the technology in
                                    2010s
                                    has caused a lot of polloution in the environment and we need to switch to
                                    non-polloution causing vehicles. He has also founded "SpaceX" which is a space
                                    exploration and research company with it main goal to make Mars as a backup for
                                    earth
                                    where humans can live. SpaceX is doing very great things, as if we kept causing
                                    polloution like this, we won't be able to survive on this planet anymore in the
                                    future.
                                    Thus we need an extra backup planet and that is what SpaceX is doing, wihch you
                                    might
                                    have seen in the movies as well.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    At this rate we might even be adopting flying cars as our daily transporation means.
                                    And
                                    soon in the future, space shuttles and space ships will not be that much costly to
                                    common man as it is now. Space travel will be common in the future if we keep
                                    developing
                                    and going ahead at this rate.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Well, the CONCLUSION has arrived, we are and will be heavily dependent on technology and if we
                        don't improve ourselves right now.
                        This might be poosible in the near future our body parts might be replaced my mechanical parts
                        like cyborgs in movies due to our laziness.
                        And that's really bad for us humans. If we make robots to do all our work, then many people will
                        be rendered jobless. And that's not it!Due to laziness people won't be healthy
                        and and would suffer many diseases all the times. Thus we conclude
                        that technoloy is good. Would be better in the future and we should use it. But the over
                        over-use of it is
                        bad. So we shouldn't be that much dependent on technology.
